BLOS RM-1 - Ring Modulator
This plugin simulates a ring modulator with two wavelengths at the users disposal.
The rate control for each controls the level of oscillation and intensity of the effect
The mix dials act as a blend between the clean signal and each wavelength.
By blending small amounts of each wavelength the user can get a tremolo effect
